In this hands-on workshop, we'll dive into the architecture of code editors and then break all the rules by creating our own weird and wonderful variations. We'll start with a journey through IDE history, then we'll get our hands dirty by building a basic editor from scratch. Once we've got the foundations, you can experiment with your own creative features.
