              This year has brought challenging moments for many in our community. When conversations about difficult or sensitive topics feel risky, how do we still connect with care and intention? This workshop offers a structured, choice-based space to practice engaging in hard conversations. Rather than focusing on specific events or personal stories, we'll center on how we speak and listen when things get tough. Practice simple communication tools through hypothetical scenarios, all at your own pace. No personal disclosure expected, no recording, no pressure.
